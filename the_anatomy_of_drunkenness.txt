TO THE FIFTH EDITION.


In preparing the present edition of the ANATOMY OF DRUNKENNESS for the
press, I have spared no pains to render the work as complete as possible.
Some parts have been re-written, some new facts added, and several
inaccuracies, which had crept into the former editions, rectified.
Altogether, I am in hopes that this impression will be considered an
improvement upon its predecessors, and that no fact of any importance has
been overlooked or treated more slightly than it deserves.

                                                                     R. M.

CHAPTER I.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.


Drunkenness is not, like some other vices, peculiar to modern times. It
is handed down to us from “hoar antiquity;” and, if the records of the
antediluvian era were more complete, we should probably find that it was
not unknown to the remotest ages of the world. The cases of Noah and Lot,
recorded in the sacred writings, are the earliest of which tradition
or history has left any record; and both occurred in the infancy of
society. Indeed, wherever the grape flourished, inebriation prevailed.
The formation of wine from this fruit, was among the earliest discoveries
of man, and the bad consequences thence resulting, seem to have been
almost coeval with the discovery. Those regions whose ungenial latitudes
indisposed them to yield the vine, gave birth to other products which
served as substitutes; and the inhabitants rivalled or surpassed those
of the south in all kinds of Bacchanalian indulgence—the pleasures of
drinking constituting one of the most fertile themes of their poetry, in
the same manner as, in other climates, they gave inspiration to the souls
of Anacreon and Hafiz.

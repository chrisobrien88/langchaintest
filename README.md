A project to get a grip on the basics of langchain

This code is used for running a retrieval-based question answering (QA) system with embeddings using the langchain library. The code demonstrates how to create and utilize a vector store to retrieve answers to questions from a given text file.

A lot of the code is taken from a tutorial which can be found here:
